# MovieWatchlist
An app that allows you to add movies to a watchlist, structuring by genre, and save it across sessions. Was a result of collaboration/hackathon w/ other coderAcademy students. Basic, but easily extendible.<br>

Can add movies to a watchlist (NOTE: IMDB top 40 is built in), sort that list by genre, and ask for a random movie.<br>

Intended to add IMDB (or similar movie database) web api functionalitty, eg. specialised searching. Also add watch/to-watch list, with rating functionality for the former. <br>

Requires the gems: 'tty-prompt' and 'tty-font', and is executed by running *control.rb*.
